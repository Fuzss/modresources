**⛓️ Grated Hopper**
- Like a hopper, but way smarter!  
- Lets you filter what goes in using up to 5 slots.  
- No filters? No problem—it works like a regular hopper.  
- Also shows off some stylish iron bars on top—function and fashion in one.

**📦 Duct**
- It's a wooden pipe for your items!  
- Sends items into connected containers, but won’t pull from them.  
- Ignores dropped items on the ground.  
- Connects in chains and works in any direction, even upwards!  

**👇 Chute**
- A super basic hopper variant made from wood!  
- Grabs items from the ground only.  
- Doesn't store anything—instantly passes items down to a container.  
- Direction? Just down. That’s all it knows.

**🚂 Hopper Minecarts**
- **Grated Hopper Minecart**: All the filtering power of the Grated Hopper, now on wheels.  
- **Chute Minecart**: Rolls around transferring picked-up items directly to containers below. Great for cleanup duty!
