**Bloomcraft** introduces charming flower-covered cows and chickens that thrive in flower forests. Each one carries a few blooms on its back, reflecting the variety and charm of its home biome. As they wander, they occasionally leave behind flowers of their type, spreading color wherever they go.

They can be milked for regular milk or even suspicious stew, just like their mushroom cousins. To make the world even livelier, several flowers from Minecraft Earth have returned, bringing new beauty to your fields and meadows.

Best of all, flower-themed mob variants are fully data driven. You can easily add your own through a simple data pack, making customization effortless and mod compatibility easy-peasy.
