Vanilla Minecraft grows azalea trees in any surface biome: even deserts and snowy tundras. A behavior officially marked as *Works As Intended* in [MC-238499](https://bugs.mojang.com/browse/MC-238499).  

**Azalea Growth Control** restores some sanity to world generation by limiting azalea trees to biomes that actually suit them. It does so through the new `azealeagrowthcontrol:grows_azalea_trees` biome tag, which defines where these trees can now appear.  

It works seamlessly with both vanilla and modded biomes, giving your worlds a more natural, consistent look. No more random green blobs in frozen wastelands!
