Ytones is the ultimate toolkit for builders who like their blocks sleek, futuristic, and endlessly versatile. 🧱 With dozens of stone-like block sets — each featuring 16 stylish variations — you'll never run out of ways to spice up your builds. Whether you're designing a sci-fi lab, a modern metropolis, or just want something cooler than cobblestone, this mod has you covered. 💡

Craft the base blocks using a key ingredient, then use the stonecutter to access all variations — or even better, cycle them on the fly right in your hotbar! 🔄 Just use two keys (`G` and `H` by default) to cycle through styles, hold `Alt` and scroll (fully configurable), or tap the hotbar key again (`1`–`9`) to swap instantly. No menus, no mess — just building flow. 🛠️

Perfect for survival bases and creative builds that don't look like they were made in 2011. 💅 Whether you're an aesthetic perfectionist or just love having options, this mod helps you build smarter, faster, and without the inventory clutter. ✨
