+ Massive thanks to [BarracudaATA](https://www.minecraftforum.net/members/BarracudaATA) for their amazing [Mineshot](https://www.minecraftforum.net/forums/mapping-and-modding-java-edition/minecraft-mods/1282034-mineshot-1-7-high-resolution-screenshot-capturing) mod, which first inspired my journey into Minecraft modding many years ago. While this project has been rebuilt from the ground up, Mineshot remains the core inspiration behind it.  
+ Huge thanks to [pascallj](https://github.com/pascallj) for keeping Mineshot alive with [Mineshot Revived](https://github.com/pascallj/mineshot-revived), which kept the spirit of the original going and inspired me to create a fully modern version of my own.
