**Shroomcraft** expands Minecraftâ€™s fungi family with new mushroom types, adorable creatures, and vegetation that bring fresh life to Mushroom Islands. Discover orange, purple, and blue mushrooms growing alongside the classic brown and red ones, from tiny sprouts to towering giants. Each type comes with matching wood, blocks, and decorations, giving builders a full palette of rich colors and textures for cozy builds and vibrant landscapes.  

Life on the islands has never been livelier. Mooshrooms now appear in every new color, joined by quirky chickens carrying mushrooms on their backs: the cluckshrooms. You might even encounter the rare shroomfin swimming in nearby waters. Beneath the surface, glowing mycelial growth lights up the caves, and spores can be crafted into mushroom bombs for a little extra mischief. Explore, build, and thrive in your very own mushroom paradise.
