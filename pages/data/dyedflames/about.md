Dyed Flames gives burning mobs a fiery makeover! No more boring orange flames—now the fire matches the source. Blue soul fire? Blue soul flames. Modded fire or fluids? Fully supported. No gameplay impact—just eye candy.

Burning mobs also emit colorful smoke trails and matching flame particles as they panic (or pose). It’s flashy, fun, and fully customizable. Whether you’re in the Nether or a modded dimension filled with fiery fluids, this mod brings the heat—your way.

Need support for custom fire types? It’s fully data-driven—just add a few lines of JSON to the built-in block [data map](https://docs.neoforged.net/docs/resources/server/datamaps/) at `dyedflames:fire_types`. No hardcoding, no hassle.
