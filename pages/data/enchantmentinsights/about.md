**Enchantment Insights** adds enchantment descriptions directly to your item tooltips, so you always know what each enchantment does. Enchantment entries look great too: dyed names, max levels, and fancy formatting with clean indentation make tooltips both clear and stylish. The enchanting table isn’t left behind either: its hints include the same descriptions, so you know exactly what you’re getting.  

Looking for neat effect descriptions too? Check out the wonderful [Effect Insights](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/effect-insights) mod!
