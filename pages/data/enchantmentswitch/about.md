**Enchantment Switch** lets you control which enchantments are active on your tools, weapons, and armor. With a simple key press while hovering your mouse cursor over an enchanted item, a menu appears showing all enchantments on that item. You can then turn each one on or off to match the situation.  

This makes it possible to combine enchantments that normally cannot exist together, as long as only one is active at a time. For example, switch between Mending and Infinity on your bow, or Sharpness and Smite on your sword. Even Frost Walker can be toggled off when you want to go swimming again.  

Curses and other special enchantments cannot be turned off, keeping gameplay fair. Disabled enchantments still appear on the tooltip with a clear strike-through effect so you always know what is active.
