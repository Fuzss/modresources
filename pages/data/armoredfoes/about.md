**Armored Foes** makes Minecraftâ€™s enemies tougher and more immersive by letting more mobs wear and show armor. Villagers, witches, and all kinds of illagers now visibly display any armor they are equipped with, just like players do.

The mod also adds natural armor spawns to certain creatures, giving them more variety and challenge. Drowned and Wither Skeletons can appear in normal armor, Piglins in gold, and Illagers will equip armor during raids. Everything is fully data driven and easy to tweak through loot tables and conditions.
