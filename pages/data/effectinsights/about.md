Effect Descriptions is very similar to the popular [Enchantment Descriptions](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/enchantment-descriptions) mod by [Darkhax](https://www.curseforge.com/members/DarkhaxDev): For every potion effect a simple explanation is added to the item tooltip. And for the effects already on your player? Simply hover over the effect widgets in your inventory to see the descriptions! Descriptions for all vanilla effects are built-in, contributing effect descriptions for modded effects is much appreciated.
