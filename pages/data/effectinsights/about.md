**Effect Insights** adds simple explanations to status effects from potions and food items, so you always know exactly what each one does. Effects on items show their descriptions directly in the tooltip, and the active effects on your player? Just hover over them in your inventory to see what they do. Everything looks neat and consistent, with clean formatting for quick understanding.
