+ Thanks a lot to [CrazyPants](https://www.curseforge.com/members/crazypants_mc_the_second) for their [Ender Zoo](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/ender-zoo) mod which I really loved and was very eager to bring back to modern versions of Minecraft and a new generation of players. Most textures in Ender Zoology are either taken or heavily based on the original textures from Ender Zoo. Almost all code is an original rewrite, meaning especially things like mob behaviors will differ from the old mod.
+ Huge thanks to [Tamlighter](https://www.curseforge.com/members/tamlighter) for creating all those amazing new textures.
