**🎭 Less Obtrusive Potion Particles**  
- 🧍 First-person view is way clearer — particles are reduced or hidden.  
- ⚙️ Can also apply to third-person or all entities, if configured. 

**🦘 Jump Boost**  
- At level 2 or higher, walk up full blocks without jumping!  
- 🏃 Great for smooth parkour and exploring uneven terrain.  

**🌫️ Blindness**  
- Now scales with potion level. Higher levels = more intense effects.  
- 👁️ Also affects mobs and reduces how far they can detect you — sneak by unseen!

**🔥 Fire Resistance**  
- 🔥 No more staying on fire after leaving lava or flames.  
- 🧯 Flame overlay is hidden — no more blinding fire in your face!  
- 🌋 See clearly while swimming in lava.  
- ✨ Smooth fade-out when the effect ends — looks so much better.  

**🌙 Night Vision**  
- No more harsh flicker when it ends.  
- 👀 Enjoy a clean, smooth transition back to normal vision.  

**🪶 Slow Falling**  
- Hold sneak to temporarily drop faster without taking fall damage.  
- 🧗 Great for Elytra landings, caves, or mountain climbing.
