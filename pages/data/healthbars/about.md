**Health Bars** adds smooth, colorful health displays for every mob around you. A clear, animated bar shows each mob’s name, health, and armor right on your screen, with floating damage numbers when they lose or regain health. It’s stylish, easy to read, and fully configurable to fit your setup.  

Health bars also appear directly in-world above mobs, showing their status as you fight or explore. From friendly animals to powerful bosses, everything stays consistent, bright, and beautifully clear.
