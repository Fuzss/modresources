<span style="color:red">⚠️⚠️ WARNING: VANILLA ITEM FRAME ENTITIES ARE CONVERTED PERMANENTLY — THEY WILL NOT RETURN AFTER UNINSTALLING THE MOD ⚠️⚠️</span>

🧱 Item Frames are now blocks, not entities — better performance!

🚀 Reduced lag when rendering and updating — big FPS improvements in areas with many frames.

💥 Proper breaking particles and compatibility with commands like `/setblock`.

⚡ Instant reactions when the supporting block is broken or moved by pistons.

✅ No downsides — still supports multiple frames in the same block space.

🌍 Seamlessly works in existing worlds — vanilla frames auto-convert on load.

🎨 Dye item frames like leather armor — unlock 5,713,438 unique colors!

🫥 Shift + right-click with empty hand to make frame invisible, leaving only the item.
