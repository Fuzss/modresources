**<span style="color:red">⚠️⚠️ WARNING: Vanilla item frame entities are converted permanently — they will not return after uninstalling the mod. ⚠️⚠️</span>**

- 🧱 **Block-Based Frames:** Item frames are now blocks instead of entities for greatly improved performance.  
- 🚀 **Less Lag:** Rendering and updates are much faster, giving big FPS boosts in areas with many frames.  
- 💥 **Better Interactions:** Includes proper breaking particles and full compatibility with commands like `/setblock`.  
- ⚡ **Instant Reactions:** Frames immediately respond when their supporting block is broken or moved by pistons.  
- ✅ **No Downsides:** Still supports multiple frames in the same block space.  
- 🌍 **World Compatibility:** Works seamlessly in existing worlds — vanilla frames auto-convert on load.  
- 🎨 **Custom Colors:** Dye item frames like leather armor to unlock 5,713,438 unique colors!  
- 🫥 **Invisible Frames:** Shift + right-click with an empty hand to hide the frame and show only the item.
