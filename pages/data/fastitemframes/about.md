Fast Item Frames completely redesigns item frames to make them work much better and faster while adding new features.

The new system reduces lag, shows particles when broken, and reacts instantly when the supporting block is removed. But that’s not all! You can now dye the frame’s background and even hide the frame itself, leaving only the item inside visible.
